       		Why Become Vegetarian? 
       	</b>
       	 </h2>
       <div class="text">
      	Again, let me state that vegetarianism isn’t for everyone. If you are fanatically devoted to meat (and I was at one time, so I understand), you might not be interested. If you already eat healthy, or you’re not interested in your health, you might not be interested.<br>
      	But there are some reasons, for the rest of us, to consider it:
       </div>
<h3>
       	<b>
       		1-Cut the fat 
       	</b>
       	 </h3>
       <div class="text">
      	While meat provides a lot of protein, it also provides a ton of fat — especially saturated fat. Which means that by cutting out meat, you’ll be cutting out a lot of bad fat, and replacing it with things that are probably not only lower in fat, but that contain some good fats. This greatly reduces your risk of heart disease, and in fact numerous studies have shown that vegetarians tend to have a lower risk of heart disease, as well as hypertension, diabetes, cancer and other diseases.
       </div>
<h3>
       	<b>
       		2-Less food poisoning. 
       	</b>
       	 </h3>
       <div class="text">
      	Food poisoning gets millions of people each year — and many of them from meat, which is a good breeding ground for harmful bacteria, especially if not stored, prepared or cooked exactly right. Cut out meat and you lower your risk of food poisoning.
       </div>
<h3>
       	<b>
       		3-Reduce the suffering. 
       	</b>
       	 </h3>
       <div class="text">
      	You probably don’t want to hear about the horrific treatment of animals that are raised for food, even before they are slaughtered for our benefit. But suffice it to say, there are great amounts of suffering involved, and by cutting out meat, you are reducing your involvement in that.
       </div>
<h3>
       	<b>
       		4-Help your weight loss.
       	</b>
       	 </h3>
       <div class="text">
      	It’s possible to be vegetarian and eat very unhealthy foods, including Coke and fries and fried stuff and pizza and chips. But it’s much more difficult. Studies repeatedly show that vegetarians are slimmer and are less likely to be obese than meat eaters. If you’re trying to lose weight, being a vegetarian can be a good part of your program.

<h3>
       	<b>
       		Set a date…or don’t
       	</b>
       	 </h3>
       <div class="text">
      	Should you go cold tofurkey? That’s up to you. You may choose to mark your calendar with the date you’ll start your vegetarian diet. Or you may decide to go with a more gradual approach.

You may find it works best to first give up red meat, then poultry, then fish. Or you may switch over your pantry to all vegetarian to start with a clean slate.

You may also choose certain days of the week to go vegetarian, like practicing Meatless Mondays. You can slowly add more days as you get more used to following this diet.
       </div>

<h3>
       	<b>
       		Resist temptation
       	</b>
       	 </h3>
       <div class="text">
      	There are many forms of the vegetarian diet, so it’s not always an all-or-nothing situation. That said, if you’re looking to avoid certain foods for a specific reason, you may consider looking for tasty alternatives by browsing around the grocery store.

You can find veggie burgers, “chicken” nuggets, and all sorts of meatlike alternatives. Keep in mind that some of these foods are processed heavily and may not be the best choice to fill up with on a regular basis.

Another approach is to focus on trying new vegetarian foods instead of focusing on what you can’t eat. Try new vegetables, preparation methods, and meat alternatives. You may discover flavors you didn’t know you liked.

<h3>
       	<b>
       		Swap ingredients
       	</b>
       	 </h3>
       <div class="text">
      	You may still be able to cook many of your favorite recipes with a vegetarian or vegan twist. Often, you can replace the main protein with a vegetarian source, like tofu or tempeh. If the recipe has an animal-based broth, you can use vegetable broth instead. If you’re avoiding dairy, try a nondairy milk such as almond or soy.<br>

Here are some swaps:
       </div>

	<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Meat, poultry, or fish</th>
    <th>Tofu, tempeh, seitan, lentils, textured vegetable protein, jackfruit, mushrooms</th> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Cheese</th>
    <th>Soy, cashew, other nut or aquafaba-based “cheeses”, nutritional yeast</th> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Beef or chicken stock or broth</th>
    <th>Vegetable stock or broth</th> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Milk</th>
    <th>Soy milk, almond milk, coconut milk, hemp milk, rice milk, flax milk</th> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Eggs (in baking)</th>
    <th>1 tablespoon ground flaxmeal or chia seeds + 3 tablespoons warm water, Ener-G Egg Replacer, ¼ cup pureed silken tofu, or try pureed banana, sweet potato, or applesauce
    </th> 
  </tr>
</table>

       <div class="text">
      	Animal ingredients may be sneaky, hiding in your favorite grocery foods or menu items. Read your labels carefully and familiarize yourself with common hidden sources of animal products.<br>

Here are a few to look out for:<br>

<b>Gelatin</b> is derived from animal collagen, and often found in processed foods such as fruit snacks, marshmallows, and Jell-O.<br>
<b>Honey</b> comes from bees, which vegans in particular may try to avoid. Honey may be found in beauty products, baked foods, and flavored teas.<br>
<b>Casein</b> is a protein derived from cow or sheep milk. It’s found in cheeses and even some vegetarian cheeses and nondairy products like soy cheese and coffee creamer.<br>
<b>Whey</b> is a byproduct of making cheese. It’s found in certain breads and candies.<br>
<b>L. cysteine</b> comes from feathers or human hair. It’s used as a dough conditioner in packaged bread products and baked goods.
