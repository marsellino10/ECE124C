     			10 Reasons to Eat Real Food
     		</b>
     	</h1>
     	<div class="text">
Real food is whole, single-ingredient food.

It is mostly unprocessed, free of chemical additives, and rich in nutrients.

In essence, it's the type of food human beings ate exclusively for thousands of years.

However, since processed foods became popular in the 20th century, the Western diet has shifted toward ready-to-eat meals.

While processed foods are convenient, they also harm your health. In fact, following a diet based on real food may be one of the most important things you can do to maintain good health and a high quality of life.

Here are 10 reasons to eat real food.

     <h2>
     	<b>
     		1. Loaded with important nutrients
     	</b>
     </h2>
      
       <div class="text">
     	Unprocessed animal and plant foods provide the vitamins and minerals you need for optimal health.

For instance, 1 cup (220 grams) of red bell peppers, broccoli, or orange slices contains more than 100% of the RDI for vitamin C (1, 2, 3).

Eggs and liver are especially high in choline, a nutrient essential for proper brain function (4Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source).

And a single Brazil nut provides a the selenium you need for an entire day (6).

In fact, most whole foods are good sources of vitamins, minerals, and other beneficial nutrients.

        <h2>
       	<b>
       		2. Low in sugar
       	</b>
       </h2>
       <div class="text">
      	Some research suggests that eating sugary foods can increase your risk of obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, and heart disease .

Generally speaking, real food is lower in sugar than many processed foods.

Even though fruit contains sugar, it's also high in water and fiber, making it much healthier than soda and processed foods.
       </div>

        <h2>
       	<b>
       		3. Heart healthy
       	</b>
       </h2>
       <div class="text">
      Real food is packed with antioxidants and nutrients that support heart health, including magnesium and healthy fats.

Eating a diet rich in nutritious, unprocessed foods may also help reduce inflammation, which is considered one of the major drivers of heart disease.
       </div>

      <h2>
       	<b>
       		4. Better for the environment
       	</b>
       </h2>
       <div class="text">
      The world population is steadily growing, and with this growth comes increased demand for food.

However, producing food for billions of people has an environmental toll.

This is partly due to the destruction of rainforests for agricultural land, increased fuel needs, pesticide use, greenhouse gases, and packaging that ends up in landfills.

Developing sustainable agriculture based on real food may help improve the health of the planet by reducing energy needs and decreasing the amount of non-biodegradable waste that humans produce.
       </div>

       <h2>
       	<b>
       		5. High in fiber
       	</b>
       </h2>
       <div class="text">
      Fiber provides many health benefits, including boosting digestive function, metabolic health, and feelings of fullness.

Foods like avocados, chia seeds, flaxseeds, and blackberries are particularly high in healthy fiber, alongside beans and legumes.

Consuming fiber through whole foods is much better than taking a supplement or eating processed food with added fiber.
       </div>
       <h2>
       	<b>
       		6. Helps control blood sugar
       	</b>
       </h2>
       <div class="text">
      According to the International Diabetes Federation, more than 400 million people have diabetes worldwide.

That number is expected to surpass 600 million within the next 25 years.

Eating a diet high in fibrous plants and unprocessed animal foods may help reduce blood sugar levels in people who have or are at risk for diabetes.

In one 12-week study, people with diabetes or prediabetes followed a paleolithic diet combining fresh meat, fish, fruits, vegetables, eggs, and nuts. They experienced a 26% reduction in blood sugar levels.

        <h2>
       	<b>
       		7. Good for your skin
       	</b>
       </h2>
       <div class="text">
      In addition to promoting better overall health, real food nourishes and helps protect your skin.

For instance, dark chocolate and avocados have been shown to protect skin against sun damage .

Studies suggest that eating more vegetables, fish, beans, and olive oil may help reduce wrinkling, loss of elasticity, and other age-related skin changes .

What's more, switching from a Western diet high in processed foods to one based on real food may help prevent or reduce acne .
       </div>

       <h2>
       	<b>
       		8. Helps lower triglycerides
       	</b>
       </h2>
       <div class="text">
      Blood triglyceride levels are strongly influenced by food intake.

Because triglycerides tend to go up when you eat sugar and refined carbs, it's best to minimize these foods or cut them out of your diet altogether.

In addition, including unprocessed foods like fatty fish, lean meats, vegetables, and nuts has been shown to significantly reduce triglyceride levels 
       </div>
       <h2>
       	<b>
       		9. Provides variety
       	</b>
       </h2>
       <div class="text">
      Eating the same foods over and over can get old. It's healthier to include diverse foods in your diet.

Hundreds of different real food options exist, including a wide variety of meat, fish, dairy, vegetables, fruits, nuts, legumes, whole grains, and seeds.

Make a point of regularly trying new foods. Some unique options include chayote squash, chia seeds, organ meats, kefir, and quinoa. 
       </div>
       <h2>
       	<b>
       		10. Costs less in the long run
       	</b>
       </h2>
       <div class="text">
      It's said that real food is more expensive than processed food.

In some ways, this adage holds true. An analysis of 27 studies from 10 countries found that eating healthier food costs about $1.56 more than processed food per 2,000 calories (23).

However, this difference is minimal compared to the cost of managing chronic lifestyle diseases, such as diabetes and obesity.

For instance, one study noted that people with diabetes spend 2.3 times more on medical supplies and health care than those who don't have this condition .

Thus, real food costs less in the long run because itâ€™s more likely to keep you healthy, minimizing your medical costs.
